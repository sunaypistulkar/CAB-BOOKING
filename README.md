## Overview
This project tried to find the best accuracy of the ML models. To empasis the optimal intelligence to cab booking company.


## Technical Aspect
Project consists of two parts

A) Exploratory Data Analysis.
1. Data preprocessing and outliers detection and their removal. 
2. Extracting the features of datetime using pandas datetime library.
3. Correlation analysis and heatmap, various probability plots, scatterplots and histograms using seaborn & matplotlib.

B) Training & Building Machine Learning Models
1. Ran various ML regression models like, KNN, SVM, Random Forest & bagging regression. 
2. To increase the accuracy of the regression analysis used AdaBoost & Grid Search CV (hyper parameter tuning) on the Random Forest
3. Used this optimized model on the test set achieved lowest LRSME Score
